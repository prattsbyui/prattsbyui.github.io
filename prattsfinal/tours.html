            <h1>Cozumel History</h1>
            <h2>From Wikipedia</h2>
            <p>The Maya are believed to have first settled Cozumel by the early part of the 1st millennium AD, and older
                Preclassic Olmec artifacts have been found on the island as well. The island was sacred to Ix Chel, the
                Maya Moon Goddess, and the temples here were a place of pilgrimage, especially by women desiring
                fertility. There are a number of ruins on the island, most from the Post-Classic period. The largest
                Maya ruins on the island were near the downtown area and have now been destroyed. Today, the largest
                remaining ruins are at San Gervasio, located approximately at the center of the island.
            </p>
            <p>As many as 10,000 Maya lived on the island then, but in 1520, infected crew members of the Pánfilo
                Narváez expedition brought the smallpox contagion to the island and by 1570 only 186 men and 172 women
                were left alive on Cozumel. In the ensuing years Cozumel was often the target of attacks by pirates, and
                in 1650 many of the islanders were forcibly relocated to the mainland town of Xcan Boloná to avoid the
                Buccaneers’ predation. Later, in 1688, most of the rest of the island's population, as well as many of
                the settlements along the Quintana Roo coast, were evacuated inland to towns such as Chemax.
            </p>
            <p>Scuba diving is still one of Cozumel's primary attractions, mainly due to the coral reef on the western
                shore of Cozumel. These coral reefs are protected from the open ocean by the island's natural geography.
                In 1996, the government of Mexico also established the Cozumel Reefs National Marine Park, forbidding
                anyone from touching or removing any marine life within the park boundaries. Despite the importance
                of healthy reefs to Cozumel's tourist trade, a deepwater pier was built in the 1990s for cruise ships to
                dock, causing damage to the reefs, and it is now a regular stop on cruises in the Caribbean. Over the
                past few decades, coral reef health has significantly declined in Cozumel, with much lower coral cover
                now present than was historically recorded.
            </p>
            <p>There was some damage to the underwater marine habitat. This included the coral reefs, which suffered
                particularly at the shallower dive sites, and the fish that inhabit the reefs.
            </p>

                <h1>San Gervasio</h1>
                <p>This pre-Hispanic settlement, located on an old cattle ranch, was baptized in the 20th century with
                    the name of its owner's saint. As in many cases, the original Mayan place name is unknown, although
                    its record is very old.
