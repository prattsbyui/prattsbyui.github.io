        <div class="home-grid">
            <div class="proximity">
                <h2>Proximity</h2>
                <h3>Amazon</h3>
                <a href="https://www.amazon.com/">amazon.com</a>
                <div class="picture"><img src="prox.jpg" alt="amazon site"></div>
                <p>This drop-menu from amazon is a great example of proximity. On smart phones it’s important the user
                    taps the intended link or button with their finger. If links are too close or too small it can lead
                    to a frustrating user experience. Thankfully, the links in this drop-menu have plenty of spacing
                    to accommodate even the fattest of digits.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="alignment">
                <h2>Alignment</h2>
                <h3>ESPN</h3>
                <a href="https://www.espn.com/">espn.com</a>
                <div class="picture"><img src="allign.jpg" alt="espn site"></div>
                <p>This is a very common alignment. Go to almost any store on the web and you’ll find the site logo in
                    the top-left and account options on the top-right. ESPN does the same thing here. You also notice
                    the alignment of other objects on this like different sport’s logos and the articles. It’s a fast
                    way to tell the user what items are related or not related.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="repitition">
                <h2>Repitition</h2>
                <h3>Wikipedia</h3>
                <a href="https://www.wikipedia.org/">wikipedia.org</a>
                <div class="picture"><img src="rep.jpg" alt="wikipendia site"></div>
                <p>Wikipedia’s use of repetition is evident in their use of color. Ever link on a wiki page is blue. We
                    see repetition of alignment where we see logo, title, and description. We also see it down in the
                    language options. Every language gets a little dot next to it. </p>
