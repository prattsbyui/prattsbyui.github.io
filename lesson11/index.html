            <h2>What Conditions Are Good For Roofing?</h2>
            <p>By Sean Pratt</p>
            <img class="roofer" src="/lesson11/images/roof.jpg" alt="slick roof">

            <p class="text">So, you are planning to work on your roof. Maybe its leaking, maybe you want a new look, or
                maybe put up holiday lights. Whatever reason you decide to work on the roof one thing to always consider
                is the weather. thank goodness for Rain/Shine, am I right? The obvious answer is to work on your roof in
                clear weather and ideal temperatures; however, other conditions are also safe for working on your roof.
                They require more preparation and planning. When it comes to roofing, if it’s raining, you’re out of
                luck. Not a good idea to tear apart you’re roof during a deluge. Thankfully temperature is not much of a
                concern except for comfort. If it’s hot try to keep cool. If it’s cold try to keep warm. In cold
                conditions be sure to watch for ice. If you have to go on your roof in snowy of icy condition because
                you are putting up Christmas decorations we recommend working from your ladder as much as possible.
                Cleated shoes would also be a good investment. Make sure they are metal as plastic cleats to slip
                easily. </p>
